# Abstract
  This document is a reference on how to create a tool that allows for the visualization of multiple climate-related datasets, and prediction of future weather trends. I will do this by utilizing various visualization and machine learning techniques to visualize the results and machine learning algorithms to predict future results. This final provides two visualizations and ML approaches to climate change visualization by using Surface Temperature and Ocean Level Variability. This multipurpose approach provides a richer understanding of climate dynamics in multiple areas and aids in the development of strategies for mitigating climate change impacts. 

# Background/Context

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our era, profoundly impacting ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide. As a part of my lifelong interest in exploring and enhancing environmental and sustainability practices, I wanted to do something that would help in that area of study. This project is inspired by partly the innovative approaches demonstrated by Pete Beckman during his recent lecture. The primary goal of this project is to implement a system that leverages machine learning, data mining, and data visualization to present a comprehensive view of climate   variability. 
  To first understand climate change, itâ€™s first important to understand the definition of climate. Climate refers to the long-term average of weather patterns over decades in a specific region, while weather describes the short-term atmospheric conditions at a particular time and place. In general, you want to consider climate as referring to changes in weather when studied for a period of over 30 years or more in a particular region. 
  As the world grapples with the challenges posed by climate change, the importance of robust, data-driven insights cannot be overstated. This project seeks to harness the power of machine learning and data visualization to provide a clearer understanding of climate dynamics and to predict future trends. By doing so, it aims to contribute meaningfully to the global effort to monitor and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
  
# Data: 
  For this project, I utilized three different datasets to gain insights into climate variability and its impacts. The first dataset, the NASA GISTEMP v4, provides a comprehensive record of climate variability across the Earth's surface. This dataset, which spans from 1880 to the present and is updated monthly, combines data from NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network version 4 (GHCN v4), which includes meteorological station data, and the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 5 (ERSST v5), which covers ocean areas. Instead of presenting absolute temperature values, it provides temperature anomalies relative to a base period of 1951-1980. This dataset is widely used by NASA to monitor and analyze both global and regional climate variability and I got it directly from the GISTEMP website. 
The second dataset is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and focuses on rising sea levels. Sea level rise, although not always visible, has significant impacts, especially for those living near the sea. This impact is exacerbated when coupled with land subsidence, which occurs due to groundwater consumption. The rise in sea levels is primarily due to temperature increases in the atmosphere. To predict future sea level rise, we used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), as it is more effective for time series forecasting than traditional methods like tidal harmonic analysis. For this analysis, we used a sea level dataset from Charleston, South Carolina, a location with nearly a century's worth of data and significant issues with land subsidence. The tools used for this analysis include PyTorch, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
